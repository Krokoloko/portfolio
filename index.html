        <h2>C#</h2>
        <p>Definetly a language I programmed a lot with in projects. I programmed a lot with this in Unity for school projects and for my own personal prototypes. </p>

        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>This is the first and favorite language I came in touch with. Have always been practicing this language to become a more reliable programmer. </p>

      <div class="item">
        <i class="fab fa-js-square fa-3x"></i>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>This language started from my least favorite to a love story with three js. To me it's a very simple way to program just like the way it is in python.</p>

        <i class="fas fa-users fa-3x"></i>
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>Without communication you will lose control over your team. I have experienced this mistake many times before but, I've learned valuable knowledge and experience in return.</p>

            Pally is a 2d game and a test ground on how to make a solid 2d platformer.

            <h2 class="descriptionHeader">In depth</h2>
            <b><p>
            Pally is a simple 2d platformer I started for fun because I wanted to create a good game for once.
            This passion project led to testing various things in 2d games with physics in particular.
            With this testing I made a solution for avoiding moving forward or stuttering against a collision box.
            </b></p>
            <h2 class="descriptionHeader">My thoughts</h2>
            <b><p>
            When I was making more time to work on this game, it became a eyeopener to me of how much fun it is to make games.
            This resulted me to reflect what I truly wanted to do in the future.
            There will be more features added such as jumping, platforms and many other mechanics you can expact from a 2d platformer.

            This was originally an assignment that I was too late to deliver for the deadline.
            However I saw the fun of finishing it untill I was satisfied with the result.
            And that was how this project came to be. It uses characters as display.
            It took me a while to arrange the board display till it was finished.

            It was a really fun project to work on. It is one of the few projects I had a lot of enjoyment and effort in it. But in the end it was worth finishing it for my self satisfaction.

            Cellular automata is a system where the cell changes depending on it's neighbours. I made it with a 1 dimensional grid which keeps evolving.

            It would've taken me less time if I designed the system class clearly with an class uml. But the result of the cellular automaton is very mesmerizing.

            It began of creating a magical wave that would loop itself which then would mesmerize you. But instead I made this cool 3d graph drawer in three js. Later I made a system which allowed me to easily implement multiple functions so no more multiple webpages.

              This piece of knowledge is where I start learn even more about calculus and machine learning.
              Linear regression is a very usefull method to get a estimate function based on data.

            <b><p>
              The essence of linear regression is that you can create a function based on points of data.
              With this you can predict a estimate out of a X input.
              In the example I used a dataset that contained the number of suicides a year.

            <b><p>
              Machine learning to me has been a subject that was very daunting to learn as I'm not that highly educated in math.
              But the way I learned Linear regression in a fashion that is written in code became more clear what it's purpose is.

              This encoder is meant for future projects that will be using save data. So I made this encoder in python.
              It will encode the string to a binary format with parsing and magical calculations. I could make it more complex so I can make it trickier to decode however,
              that is something I will let it rest and work on it when I feel to do so.

        <h2>I'm Daan Joachim Ruting</h2>
        <img src="content/About_Me/meSquared.jpg">

        <h3>My Objectives</h3><p>
          My passion is creating 2d games, not to say that 3d games are horrible.
          Before I found my passion to create 2d games I also wanted to learn how to create AI.
          I have acquired a little internship experience at a big data company called Cmotions.
          But in conclusion I couldn’t see myself in the future leading the greatest life working on the kind of projects they deliver and that was the same moment I found the fun in making 2d games that I had lost.
          What I’m most interested in are 2d games which I have grown fond of since my childhood period like Pokemon and Mario.
          Creating them of course is a different story which requires a lot of knowledge and work ethic.
          But as far as I know, I definitely want to create more 2d games on those standards and qualities in the future.
        <p>
        <h3>Passion & Interests</h3><p>
        I love listening to music, which also led me to learn and play bass guitar.
        I'm currently trying to learn japanese myself by translating japanese comics to syllables.
        I have done a lot of different sports.
        For the past 10 years I train and play volleyball in competition.
        Naturally I’m a gaming fanatic with currently a specific interest in a competitive game called Super smash bros ultimate.
        I'm also aware what is happening in the competitive scene thats mostly held in the US.
        I frequently participate in tournaments held in Amsterdam.</p>
