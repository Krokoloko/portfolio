            <!-- <p>
              My passion is creating 2d games, not to say that 3d games are horrible.
              Before I found my passion to create 2d games I also wanted to learn how to create AI.
              I have acquired a little internship experience at a big data company called Cmotions.
              But in conclusion I couldn’t see myself in the future working on these kind of projects.
              At that moment I found the fun in making 2d games since investing my time I started.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I’m most interested in are 2d games which I have grown fond of like Pokemon, Metroid, Sonic and Mario.
              Creating them of course is a different story which requires a lot of knowledge, experience and work ethic.
              But as far as I know, I definitely want to create more 2d games on those standards and qualities in the future.
            </p> -->
            <p>
            My passion is making games, may it be VR games, sandbox games or platform games, I love to program games.
            Before I found my passion to make games I also wanted to learn how to make AI.
            I have acquired a little internship experience at a big data company called Cmotions.
            But in conclusion I couldn’t see myself in the future working on these kind of projects.
            At that moment I found the fun in making games ever since I start investing more time in making games.

            <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
            <p>
              I love listening to music, which also led me to learn and play bass guitar.
              I'm currently learning japanese through online courses with other fellows.
              I have done a lot of different sports.
              For the past 10+ years I train and play volleyball in competition and recently made an effort in roller skating.
            </p>
            <p>
              Naturally I’m a gaming fanatic with currently a specific interest in the competitive scene of a game called Super smash bros ultimate.
              I'm also aware what is happening in the competitive scene thats mostly seen in the US, EU and Japan.
              I frequently participate in tournaments held in Amsterdam and practice on becoming a better player as well.

              The intake assesment had to be programmed in c++ and the game had to fall under the theme of Waves.
              I came up with the idea to make endless runner esque game where you had to jump over waves and after having ran far enough, you would face a stage boss. <br><br>
              Due to my inexperience with c++ and time constraints, I was only able to program the waves, collision and the jumping. With this assesment, I was able to get selected in the studies.
              Unfortunately due to Covid circumstances, the studies didn't go smoothly as I'd liked. Since I had to move to Breda which was a totally new environment compared to Amsterdam.
              In these studies I couldn't get the support I needed and the social aspect among us students was very lacking.

              Fantasy world is a game made towards a younger demographic to get them interested in programming.
              In Fantasy world, you get the freedom to place objects around the world and assign those objects with their own behaviour.
              <br><br>For this project I was responsible for handling the placement of these objects, the highlight material when the object was being placed, the object menu on the top left and the object spawn menu on the right.
              The team also had to deliver certain documentation for this project.
              I was part of writing a class diagram, proceedings, test reports, test plans, the IDE document and supported in writing most of the other documentation.

              Later I had the idea to make this a 2d platformer puzzle game.
              This passion project led to testing various things in 2d games with physics in particular.
              For instance: from a lot of testing, I made a solution for avoiding moving forward or stuttering against a collision box.

              This resulted me to reflect what I wanted to do in the future.

                Machine learning to me has been a subject that was very daunting to learn as I'm not that highly educated in math.
                But the way I learned Linear regression in a fashion that was explained in code became more clear to me what its purpose is.

                <p><b>This is a python program that allows you to encode and decode a string.
                The encoder is made by my handcrafted algorithms.

                This encoder is meant for future projects that will be using save data. So I made this encoder in python.
                It will encode the string to a binary format with parsing and some calculations. I could make it more complex so I can make it trickier to decode it,
                however that is something I will let it rest and work on it when I feel to do so.
