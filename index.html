        <div>
          <h2>I'm Daan Joachim Ruting <br> born in 1999 in Amsterdam</h2>

          <img src="content/About_Me/meSquared.jpg">
          <h3>My Purpose & Objectives</h3><p>For now, I want to complete and later extend my studies to become a professional in Python where I apply my skills in customer driven projects and assignments.<br>
          But! - my ultimate aspiration is to study humanity and build the most human AI there is to exist. <br>
          And why you ask? It’s my utmost curiosity and desire to understand and model the complexity of the human intelligence.
          I’d rather start my initiatives as soon as possible to grasp the opportunity, experiment and learn.
          The insights I discover, I wish to apply in making simulators and games.<p>
          <h3>Skills</h3><p>Being a student, I develop myself and work as a programmer (Pyhton, C#, PhP, C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS5).<br>
          I prefer to work in teams (agile/scrum) to create prototypes and solutions.<br>
          I prepare and give presentations on the projects and I also create most of the planning and the progress.<br>
          My experience comprises of: making project preparations, building use cases, setting programming conventions, creating functional and technical design, programming, debugging, documenting, designing algorithms&classes.<br>
          I have been working in more than 30 projects and have presented 80% of those projects.<p>
          <h3>Preference</h3><p>
          I prefer to work with poeple who have a good sense of making agreements.<br>
          As someone who likes these agreements I also try as hard as I can to meet with these agreements.
          </p>
          <h3>Passion & Interest's</h3><p>
          I love listening to music, which also led me to learn and play bass guitar. <br>
          I have done a lot of different sports. <br>
          For the last seven years I train and play volleyball in competition. <br>
          Naturally I’m a gaming fanatic with currently a specific interest in a competitive game called Super smash bros melee.
          So far I've only participated in these tournaments.
          <ul>
            <li>Vedette 2018-08-26</li>
            <li>Vedette 2018-10-07</li>
          </ul>
          However I'm well aware what is happening in the competitive scene thats mostly held in the US.</p>

              <h3 class="descriptionHeader">In depth</h3>
              This was originally an assignment that I was too late to deliver for the deadline.
              However I saw the fun of finishing this game untill I was satisfied with the result.
              And that was how this project came to be. It uses characters as display.
              It took me a while to arrange the board display till it was finished.
              <h3 class="descriptionHeader">Conclusion</h3>
              It was really fun project to work on. It is one of the few projects I had a lot of enjoyment and effort in it. But in the end it was worth finishing it for my self satisfaction.

              It began of creating magical wave that would loop itself which then would mesmerize you. But instead I made this cool 3d graph drawer in three js. Later I made a system which allowed me to easily implement multiple functions so no more multiple webpages.
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              It took me a long while to get the basic drawing to work but it had its shares of my interests which is programming and mathematics.

                This encoder is meant for future projects that will be using save data. So I made this encoder in python.
                It will encode itself to a binary format with some calculations. I could make it more complex so I can make trickier to decode however,
                that is something I will be working on in the near future.

              We were tasked to recreate a game with a certain twist to it.<br>
              I got the opportunity to program the A.I. in this game which was a lot of fun.<br>

              <h3 class="descriptionHeader">In depth</h3>
              Our goal of this project was to remake the game cuphead what was shown in the video footage of 30 seconds.<br>
              We had to program a playable character who can shoot, walk, jump and crouch. And 3 enemy's which damage through, colliding or from a projectile.<br>
              <h3 class="descriptionHeader">Conclusion</h3>
              The project ended up being 'ok'. The assets were well executed but our team work and communication was very sloppy.<br>
              What I did learn from this project though is how to work with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and inheritance.

                We made a 2d puzzle platformer game where you had to rely on the games physics to solve puzzles.

                <h3 class="descriptionHeader">In depth</h3>
                The myth we had to base this game upon was the myth pukwudgie.
                The myth is about little creatures in the woods who commit mischief to the poeple they come across.
                We brainstormed to create ideas what game we could make out of it and we came to the conclusion that we wanted to make a puzzle game out of it.

                <h3 class="descriptionHeader">My contribution</h3>
                I've had many group projects where I had to do most of the work, to the extent that I had to write almost all the scripts (and fix scripts of others).
                These include all the <a href="https://github.com/Krokoloko/Mythe2018/tree/master/Mythe/Assets/Scripts/player" target="_blank">player-scripts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Krokoloko/Mythe2018/tree/master/Mythe/Assets/Scripts/Enemy" target="_blank">enemy behaviours</a> and most of the <a href="https://github.com/Krokoloko/Mythe2018/tree/master/Mythe/Assets/Scripts/Objects" target="_blank">objects</a>
                <h3 class="descriptionHeader">Conclusion</h3>
                As result we had a decent prototype with nice looking visuals. But for a project where we had 10 weeks it was quite underwhelming.
